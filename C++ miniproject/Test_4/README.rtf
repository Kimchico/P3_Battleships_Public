You need to compile with the following sentence:\
g++ -std=c++11 fileToCompile.cpp -o a.out\
\
You have to change the fileToCompile.cpp to Server.cpp and run it.\
The second time you run it fileToCompile.cpp is changed to Client.ccp and a.out is changed to b.out\
\
\
Then open 4 windows and write the following in each:\
\
./a.out\
./b.out\
./b.out\
